Turn your iPhone into a ham radio beacon station. Generate tones for antenna tuning, transmit CW, or loop voice messages—all with adjustable cadence.

## Description
> 4,000 character limit

Amateur Radio Beacon transforms your iPhone or iPad into a versatile beacon station for ham radio operators. Connect your device to your transceiver's audio input and let it handle the repetitive work of beacon operation.

THREE POWERFUL MODES

Tone Mode
Generate a pure sine wave tone at any frequency from 200 Hz to 2,000 Hz. Perfect for antenna tuning, testing your audio chain, or running a continuous carrier. Preset buttons for common frequencies (400 Hz, 700 Hz, 1000 Hz) let you switch quickly.

CW Mode
Enter any text and the app converts it to properly-timed Morse code. Adjust speed from 5 to 40 WPM to match your preference. See a live preview of the dots and dashes before transmission, along with the calculated duration.

Message Mode
Record voice messages directly in the app for ID announcements or beacon operation. Select from your saved recordings and let the app loop them automatically.

FLEXIBLE CADENCE CONTROL

Every mode includes cadence settings so you can configure exactly how your beacon operates:
- Loop continuously for unattended operation
- Set a pause between transmissions (1-300 seconds)

DESIGNED FOR VOX OPERATION

The app outputs audio only—it doesn't control PTT directly. Configure your transceiver's VOX to key from the audio input, and the beacon runs hands-free. This approach works with virtually any radio that has an audio input jack.

LOCALIZED IN 8 LANGUAGES

Available in English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

IMPORTANT: LICENSE REQUIRED

This app is intended for licensed amateur radio operators. Before transmitting:
- Hold a valid amateur radio license
- Ensure beacon operation is permitted under your license class
- Operate only on authorized frequencies
- Follow proper station identification procedures

Whether you're tuning an antenna, testing propagation, or running an unattended beacon, Amateur Radio Beacon gives you the tools you need in a clean, focused interface.
